# Keif-Gotchi CLI 🐙

> "Coding alone is dangerous. Take a Kraken with you."

Keif-Gotchi is a gamified CLI tool that acts as your **Accountability Partner**. It lives in your terminal and feeds on your git commits.

## Features

- **Feed on Code**: Every commit feeds Keif.
- **Evolve**: Your coding style determines Keif's evolution (Architect, Hacker, or Chaos).
- **Git-Roast**: Keif judges your commits.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g keif-gotchi-cli
```

## Usage

Initialize in your repo:
```bash
keif init
```

Check status:
```bash
keif status
```

## Evolution Paths

- **Architect**: Clean commits, good messages.
- **Hacker**: Late night coding, high frequency.
- **Chaos**: Large commits, WIPs.
